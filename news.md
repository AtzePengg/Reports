The intersection of AI and energy is becoming a critical strategic issue, especially for tech-forward economies like Switzerland. On one side, the soaring demand for computing power – particularly from AI model training and large-scale cloud services – is driving a buildout of data centers globally. These server farms consume enormous electricity. A vivid example discussed at Davos is the “Stargate” project, which aims to develop new data centers alongside dedicated power plants to satisfy the “voracious power needs” of advanced AI. While such projects might not be in Switzerland yet, the country is a prime candidate for data center expansion due to its political stability and cool climate. Swiss energy planners thus anticipate increased load on the grid from potential new high-performance computing hubs. Business leaders, particularly in finance and IT, are mindful that any constraints in energy supply or spikes in power costs could hamper AI operations. This is why there’s growing interest in energy-efficient AI and renewable energy investments.

On the flip side, AI is also a key part of the solution to energy challenges. Swiss utilities are leveraging AI for smart grid management: AI systems predict consumption patterns, detect faults, and dynamically route electricity, all of which improves reliability and reduces waste. In renewable energy, AI algorithms help in predicting solar and wind output and in automating maintenance (like using drones and AI vision to inspect solar farms or hydroelectric dams). These efficiencies are crucial, as Switzerland’s energy strategy leans heavily on renewables and hydropower – AI helps maximize these clean resources, effectively offsetting the power used by AI data centers with savings elsewhere.

The recent debut of the Alps supercomputer (in Lugano) – capable of heavy AI workloads – was accompanied by studies showing it adds only about 0.013% to Switzerland’s annual CO2 emissions. This finding, credited to energy-efficient design and Switzerland’s low-carbon electricity mix, provides a proof of concept that high-end computing can be environmentally sustainable. Globally, energy leaders at Davos identified AI as both a stressor and a tool for the energy sector. For Swiss decision-makers, the imperative is to ensure the electric infrastructure keeps pace with digital growth. That means investing in grid upgrades and renewable capacity now, so that as AI-driven enterprises expand, Switzerland can power them reliably and greenly.

In sum, the synergy of AI and energy is a double narrative: AI’s growth requires careful energy planning, and smart energy management increasingly requires AI. Forward-thinking companies are now engaging in both – adopting AI, and simultaneously supporting the energy innovations that will sustain AI’s future.
