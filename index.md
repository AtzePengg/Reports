# GPU Hardware Requirements for Large-Scale LLM Inference (70B vs. 671B Models)

Large language models (LLMs) with tens or hundreds of billions of parameters demand powerful GPU hardware for efficient inference. This review focuses on the past year’s literature (2024–early 2025) regarding GPU requirements for two model scales – roughly **70 billion** and **671 billion** parameters – summarizing current GPU offerings, memory/throughput needs, performance benchmarks, cost considerations, and gaps for future work. Citations to recent papers, benchmarks, and technical blogs are provided throughout.

## 1. State of Current GPU Offerings

### Leading GPU Models for LLM Inference

Modern LLM inference relies on GPUs with large memory and high throughput. In 2023-2024, **NVIDIA’s A100 (80GB)** and newer **H100 (80GB)** have been the workhorses for serving models around the 70B scale. The H100 introduced higher Tensor Core throughput and support for FP8/FP4 precision, yielding significant speedups over the A100​ [(BLOGS.NVIDIA.COM)](https://blogs.nvidia.com). Consumer GPUs like the **RTX 3090/4090** (24GB) have also been used in experiments, but their smaller VRAM often requires model compression or multi-GPU setups. **AMD’s Instinct** line has emerged as a competitor: the **MI250** was used in some 2023 tests, and in 2024 **MI300X** (with 192GB HBM3 memory) debuted, targeting large-model inference​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com) [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com). Looking ahead, NVIDIA’s next-gen **Blackwell** GPUs (e.g. “B100/B200”) were previewed in late 2024 and feature 180GB memory and second-generation Transformer Engine support​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com) [(BLOGS.NVIDIA.COM)](https://blogs.nvidia.com).

### Inference Performance of Current GPUs

Reported benchmarks show that a single high-end GPU can generate tens of tokens per second for a 70B model under optimal conditions. For example, one NVIDIA H100 (80GB) can achieve around *25 tokens/second* on a 70B model using 4-bit weight quantization​ [(GITHUB.COM)](https://github.com). An A100 80GB is only slightly behind (~22 t/s on the same test)​ [(GITHUB.COM)](https://github.com). These figures assume the model fits fully in GPU memory – which 70B can with compression – avoiding CPU transfer bottlenecks. By contrast, consumer cards with 24–48GB VRAM struggle with 70B models unless heavily quantized. Community benchmarks with **RTX 4090s** show that *two* 24GB GPUs (combined 48GB) can generate on the order of ~19 t/s on a quantized 70B model​ [(GITHUB.COM)](https://github.com), while a single 24GB card cannot hold the model at all in FP16 (out-of-memory)​ [(GITHUB.COM)](https://github.com). This underscores the need for either large-memory GPUs or multi-GPU splitting for such models.

### New GPUs and Specialized Accelerators

The past year brought memory-boosted variants and novel chips to address LLM demands. **NVIDIA’s H100 NVL/H200** (essentially H100 with 2× memory up to 140+ GB via dual-GPU modules) were shown to substantially improve 70B model throughput – one H200 delivered ~1.6× to 1.9× the performance of a standard H100 on Llama-2 70B by alleviating memory bandwidth constraints​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com) [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com). AMD’s **MI300X**, with its 192GB of HBM3, can host a 70B model in full precision on one card. MLPerf results in late 2024 showed a single MI300X reaching **2,530 tokens/sec** on Llama-2 70B (server scenario)​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com), roughly on par with an H100 system (the MI300X was within ~7% of an H100’s throughput)​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com). NVIDIA’s upcoming **Blackwell** GPUs promise another leap: in MLPerf v4.1 tests, a single Blackwell prototype achieved up to **4× the H100’s throughput** on Llama-2 70B by using FP4 precision Tensor Cores​ [(BLOGS.NVIDIA.COM)](https://blogs.nvidia.com). It’s worth noting non-GPU ASICs as context – for instance, Cerebras’s wafer-scale engine claimed **2,100 tokens/sec** on Llama-70B in Oct 2024​ [(CEREBRAS.AI)](https://cerebras.ai) – but for this review we focus on GPU solutions, as they remain the primary hardware for large-scale inference.

## 2. Memory and Throughput Requirements

### VRAM Requirements (70B vs 671B)

Memory is the first hurdle in serving massive models. A dense 70B parameter model in full FP16 precision requires roughly **140–160 GB of VRAM** just to store weights (70B × 2 bytes/param ≈ 140 GB, plus extra for activations and caches). In practice, recent guides recommend about *160 GB* GPU memory for a 70B model to run comfortably​ [(NODESHIFT.COM)](https://nodeshift.com). This means at least *3–4 high-memory GPUs* (e.g. 3×80GB A100) if running in 16-bit precision​ [(NODESHIFT.COM)](https://nodeshift.com). Techniques like weight quantization can cut this requirement substantially: 8-bit weights halve the size (~70–80 GB for 70B), and 4-bit nearly quarter it (~35–40 GB). Indeed, a 4-bit quantized 70B model can fit on a single 48GB card (with some memory to spare for overhead) – one recent benchmark showed a 70B model in 4-bit running on an 80GB A100 or H100 with no offloading​ [(GITHUB.COM)](https://github.com), and even two 24GB GPUs in tandem were enough to hold a 70B in 4-bit mode​ [(GITHUB.COM)](https://github.com). However, for *full* precision or larger context windows, multiple GPUs or swapping to CPU memory is needed.

For a **671B parameter model**, the raw memory demands are orders of magnitude higher. **Full FP16 weights would occupy ~1.34 TB of VRAM**, far beyond any single GPU. Even with 8-bit compression, you’d need on the order of 0.67 TB. The largest GPU servers today (e.g. 8×80GB H100) provide only 640 GB total, so a 671B model *must* be sharded across many devices or use out-of-core memory. A recent community guide suggests roughly **16×80GB GPUs** (1280 GB total) as a minimum to load a 671B model, noting ~1.342 TB is theoretically required​ [(NODESHIFT.COM)](https://nodeshift.com). In other words, something like 2× HGX chassis (each with 8 A100/H100) linked by NVSwitch would be needed just to store the model in memory. If the model uses sparse activation (which is the case for **DeepSeek-R1 671B**, a Mixture-of-Experts model), the *active* parameters per token are lower (DeepSeek activates ~37B of the 671B for each inference step​ [(NODESHIFT.COM)](https://nodeshift.com)). This means the compute and memory *access* footprint per token is comparable to a 37B model, but **all** weights (671B worth) still need to reside somewhere (VRAM or system memory). Thus, extremely large models often rely on **system RAM** as an overflow. For example, running a 671B model with CPU offloading might use >500 GB of host RAM in addition to GPU memory​ [(NEWS.YCOMBINATOR.COM)](https://news.ycombinator.com). In one case, users managed to load a 671B in 4-bit quantization across CPU memory (512 GB RAM) and achieve inference, though at slow speeds​ [(NEWS.YCOMBINATOR.COM)](https://news.ycombinator.com).

### Throughput Requirements and Scaling

Achieving useful throughput (tokens/sec) with these models is challenging due to their size. A 70B model, when fully GPU-resident, can generate tokens at a reasonable rate: e.g. Meta’s optimized LLaMA-2 70B can exceed **2,000 tokens/s** on a single node with 8× high-end GPUs. MLPerf v4.1 results showed around 2,700 t/s per H100 (when serving multiple requests in parallel, “server mode”)​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com), and similarly ~2,530 t/s on an MI300X​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com) for Llama-2 70B. These high throughput figures come from batch-serving or multi-stream scenarios where the GPU is kept busy (often using frameworks like TensorRT or FasterTransformer to batch inference). In a single-stream, low-latency setting (batch size 1), throughput is much lower – on the order of tens of tokens/sec – because the model’s enormous size makes each token’s computation lengthy. For instance, without any special optimizations, one H100 was measured at ~**51 tokens/s** generating Llama-70B text (batch=1, full context)​ [(DEVELOPER.NVIDIA.COM)](https://developer.nvidia.com). Techniques like **speculative decoding** can trade some extra computation for higher throughput: NVIDIA reported that using a draft model for speculative decoding boosted single-H100 output from 51 t/s to over 160 t/s (3× faster) on a 70B model​ [(DEVELOPER.NVIDIA.COM)](https://developer.nvidia.com). This shows that *throughput requirements (e.g. wanting >100 t/s)* may be met not just by brute-force hardware, but also by algorithmic improvements.

For a 671B model, *raw throughput per device* will be much lower, roughly proportional to the active parameters per token. If we consider the worst case of a dense 671B (where every token uses all weights), it would be ~9.5× more compute than a 70B model, so one might expect an order of magnitude drop in t/s on the same hardware. Indeed, running a 671B model fully on CPUs yields very slow speeds (fractions of a token per second)​ [(NEWS.YCOMBINATOR.COM)](https://news.ycombinator.com) [(NEWS.YCOMBINATOR.COM)](https://news.ycombinator.com). However, the actual DeepSeek-R1 671B uses sparse experts (≈37B active), so the compute per token is closer to a 40B model. This makes **20 tokens/s** plausible on a multi-GPU system. There are no published GPU benchmarks for 671B dense models in 2024, but anecdotal data exists for DeepSeek: one experiment ran DeepSeek-671B in 8-bit on a dual-socket AMD server with 768GB of RAM and reached **6–8 tokens/s**​ [(NEWS.YCOMBINATOR.COM)](https://news.ycombinator.com). In 4-bit on a single socket with 512GB, it achieved ~**3.5–4.3 t/s**​ [(NEWS.YCOMBINATOR.COM)](https://news.ycombinator.com). These were CPU-bound runs; a GPU-based approach (with ~16 GPUs) should significantly outperform that, potentially into the tens of tokens/sec. Still, to reach **100+ t/s** with a ~600B-class model likely requires *massive parallelism* (multiple nodes of GPUs or next-generation accelerators). No public evidence yet shows 100 t/s on a 600B model – this remains a target for future optimization.

### Memory Bandwidth and I/O Considerations

It’s important to note that large-model inference is often *memory-bound* rather than purely compute-bound. Each token generation entails reading huge weight matrices and performing relatively regular matrix ops. If the model is sharded across GPUs, the interconnect speed (NVLink/NVSwitch or PCIe) can bottleneck performance. The recent MLPerf tests revealed that H100 GPUs were “underprovisioned on the memory front” – their 80GB HBM2e and 2.0+ TB/s bandwidth were not enough to fully feed the compute for 70B inference​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com) [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com). Upgrading to HBM3 (as in H200 with 141GB @ 4.8 TB/s) yielded **1.6–1.9× higher throughput** on Llama-2 70B, purely from alleviating memory constraints​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com). This indicates that **memory capacity and bandwidth** scale almost as importantly as FLOPs for LLM inference. Similarly, if part of the model resides in CPU RAM, the PCIe transfer each token can severely degrade throughput. Users report that running a model from NVMe (disk) or slow DDR4 memory can drop throughput to near-zero (e.g. ~0.15 t/s) because the system spends most time swapping weights in/out​ [(NEWS.YCOMBINATOR.COM)](https://news.ycombinator.com). In summary, to meet high throughput requirements, one must ensure the model (or at least the portions needed per token) sit in the fastest memory possible (GPU HBM or at worst DDR5 RAM), and that GPUs are interconnected with high-bandwidth links to minimize latency when they communicate.

## 3. Performance Metrics and Benchmarks

### Throughput Benchmarks (tokens/sec)

A variety of benchmark results from 2024 illustrate the throughput achievable on different hardware setups:

- **Single-GPU Performance (70B):** Using 4-bit quantization to fit the model, an **NVIDIA A100 80GB** generates about **22 tokens/s** for LLaMA-3 70B, while an **H100 80GB** achieves ~**25 tokens/s** under the same conditions​ [(GITHUB.COM)](https://github.com). These numbers were measured with the `llama.cpp` framework (GPU offloading) and represent an average generation speed for a long sequence. They align with other reports that put 20–30 t/s as typical for one high-end GPU handling a 70B model. Without quantization (i.e. using full FP16), a single GPU generally cannot even load a 70B model unless it’s an H100/MI300 with huge memory – and even then, the throughput would be lower due to heavier computation.

- **Multi-GPU Scaling (70B):** Adding GPUs can increase throughput, but with diminishing returns if not properly optimized. For instance, using **2× 24GB GPUs** (e.g. two 3090s) to split a 70B model, one report achieved ~**16–19 t/s**​ [(GITHUB.COM)](https://github.com) – roughly in line with a single 80GB GPU, indicating some overhead from splitting. In contrast, an 8×GPU server (such as NVIDIA’s HGX with 8×A100 80GB) can surpass 100 tokens/s if running in throughput-oriented mode. MLPerf “offline” throughput for 8×A100 on 70B was not directly published, but we can infer: an 8-way H100 system was estimated to generate *~2,700 t/s* in server mode (multiple queries)​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com), which would be lower in single-stream but still very high. **20 tokens/s** is therefore attainable with even 1–2 GPUs, while reaching **100 t/s** typically requires a cluster of 4–8 GPUs or aggressive batching. As a concrete example, NVIDIA’s inference library using speculative decoding managed ~**134–182 t/s** on a single H200 (batch size 1) by using a small “draft” model alongside the 70B model​ [(DEVELOPER.NVIDIA.COM)](https://developer.nvidia.com). Without that, the baseline was ~51 t/s​ [(DEVELOPER.NVIDIA.COM)](https://developer.nvidia.com). Thus, a goal of 100 t/s for 70B can be met by either using ~4 GPUs (each ~25 t/s) or by advanced optimizations on fewer GPUs. The trade-off often comes in latency: batching many requests or tokens improves throughput but adds delay for individual responses.

- **Larger Models (671B) Benchmarks:** There is a paucity of public data for 600B-scale models, as few organizations have run them outside of labs. The best hints come from the DeepSeek-671B (which is MoE). In user-level tests (CPU-based, as noted earlier), it reached up to ~**8 tokens/s** with heavy quantization​ [(NEWS.YCOMBINATOR.COM)](https://news.ycombinator.com). No official GPU benchmark for 671B was published in MLPerf 2024 (the largest tested was 70B). However, we can extrapolate from 70B results and smaller models. If 16 GPUs are used for 671B, and assuming near-linear scaling from a 70B baseline, one might target on the order of 50–100 tokens/s in a throughput scenario. Achieving **20 t/s** on a 671B model is likely possible today with a sufficiently large GPU server (for example, if one H100 does ~3 t/s of a 600B model, then 8–10 H100s could get ~24–30 t/s). Indeed, the NodeShift guide suggests 16×A100 for “smooth” operation​ [(NODESHIFT.COM)](https://nodeshift.com), which would provide headroom to reach decent speeds per token. That said, hitting **100 t/s** on a 600B+ model currently pushes the envelope of feasibility – it might require **multiple nodes** of GPUs (tens of GPUs total) or waiting for next-gen hardware. NVIDIA’s own projections with Blackwell (and its larger memory and FP4 capability) indicate substantial speedups, but those were demonstrated on 70B; whether a 600B dense model can be served at 100+ t/s will depend on parallelizing across many chips and overcoming communication overhead.

### Latency and Real-World Constraints

Beyond raw tokens/sec, it’s crucial to consider *latency per token* and *end-to-end response time*. Large models typically have high **first-token latency** because the entire model must be loaded and the first forward pass computed. Cerebras reported that their Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE) could deliver a first token in ~0.4s for 70B, versus *1.1–4.2 seconds* on various GPU setups​ [(CEREBRAS.AI)](https://cerebras.ai). This gap is due to GPUs often needing to coordinate across multiple devices (and possibly nodes), incurring network latency. Techniques like pipeline parallelism, KV cache, and optimized scheduling are used to mitigate this, but deployment scenarios requiring real-time responses (e.g. interactive chat at <1s latency) may find giant models challenging. Even if throughput is high in steady-state, the *time to generate one full response* could be constrained by how fast the first few tokens output. For example, a system might achieve 100 t/s with heavy batching, but if that batch method introduces a 2-second delay to start generating, it might be unsuitable for live interaction. Therefore, the literature often distinguishes *throughput benchmarks* (max tokens/sec, often measured in an offline or multi-stream scenario) and *single-stream latency* (how quickly one query is completed). Both 70B and 671B models in practice may use **multi-GPU inference with model sharding**, which introduces synchronization points that can hurt latency. One positive trend is the move to *lower precision arithmetic (FP8, INT4)* which both reduces memory use and speeds up computation, partially offsetting the size growth. NVIDIA’s use of FP8 in H100 and FP4 in Blackwell is a key example – they squeeze more performance out per GPU for LLM tasks​ [(BLOGS.NVIDIA.COM)](https://blogs.nvidia.com). We also see frameworks enabling **streaming inference** (outputting tokens continuously rather than waiting for the whole generation) to hide some latency and keep throughput high.

## 4. Cost and Feasibility Implications

### Hardware Acquisition Costs

The GPUs capable of serving 70B+ models are expensive, and cost grows superlinearly for the largest models (since you need many GPUs and high-end infrastructure). As of 2024, an **NVIDIA A100 80GB** card was roughly on the order of $10–15k on secondary markets (higher when scarce), and **H100 80GB** often ranges $25–$30k+ each. Enterprise GPU servers (8× A100/H100 with NVSwitch backplane) can cost well over $100k. One analysis estimated a fully outfitted 8×H100 server (including CPUs, RAM, etc.) at around **$150,000**​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com). Needing 16 GPUs for a 671B model might mean a $300k hardware requirement just for the accelerators. Upcoming Blackwell GPUs with 180GB memory are expected to be even pricier (NVIDIA’s CEO hinted at ~$40k per Blackwell GPU, though market demand could drive it to $50k​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com)). AMD’s MI300X is similarly a very costly piece of hardware, but AMD’s strategy in 2024 was to compete on price/performance; it’s reported that MI300X offers slightly better *bang-per-buck* than H100 for 70B inference in at least one scenario​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com). This means if an H100 node and an MI300X node deliver similar throughput, the MI300X may come at a lower total system cost, partly due to needing fewer of them (one MI300X has enough memory for 70B, whereas one H100 might not, requiring multiple H100s or the premium H100 NVL). However, NVIDIA’s large market share and aggressive roadmap (H200, Blackwell) suggest the cost efficiency could swing back if they price the new GPUs competitively​ [(NEXTPLATFORM.COM)](https://nextplatform.com).

### Cloud Rental Pricing

For teams that cannot afford on-prem clusters, cloud GPU instances are available but come with high operating expenses. In late 2024, an AWS **p4d.24xlarge** instance (8×A100 40GB) was about **$32.77/hour** on-demand​ [(INSTANCES.VANTAGE.SH)](https://instances.vantage.sh), and the newer **p4de.24xlarge** (8×A100 80GB) about **$40.97/hour**​ [(COSTCALC.CLOUDOPTIMO.COM)](https://costcalc.cloudoptimo.com). The latest **p5.48xlarge** (8×H100 80GB) is roughly **$98/hour** on-demand​ [(INSTANCES.VANTAGE.SH)](https://instances.vantage.sh) – nearly $100/hour for a single server. At that rate, serving a model continuously 24/7 can incur ~$70k per month in cloud costs for just one instance. To put in perspective, if that one instance delivers ~20–30 tokens/s for a 70B model, the cost per token generated can be estimated. Taking 25 t/s on H100 (from earlier) at $98/hour: that’s 25×3600 = 90k tokens/hour for $98, or **$1.09 per million tokens**. This is just a ballpark – actual costs depend on utilization and precision, but it shows that running large models is not cheap. Some community members have found cheaper alternatives: e.g. using second-hand GPUs and local setups. One Reddit discussion detailed a used server with old **NVIDIA P40** cards (Pascal generation, 24GB each) that cost under $1000 total and achieved ~7–10 tokens/s on a 70B model (quantized)​ [(REDDIT.COM)](https://reddit.com). That works out to an extremely low cost-per-token after the one-time hardware buy. Another user calculated that **1 million tokens of inference on a 70B model cost only about $0.70** in electricity on their home rig​ [(REDDIT.COM)](https://reddit.com). These anecdotal reports highlight a huge range of cost scenarios – from sub-dollar per million tokens on DIY setups (with the trade-off of lower speed), up to several dollars per million tokens on cloud GPUs.

### Energy Efficiency

Running large LLMs is power-intensive. A single H100 SXM module can draw up to ~700W under load, and an 8×GPU server can easily pull 5–6 kW. At typical data center electricity prices, that might be $0.50–$1.00 per hour in energy per server. For a model like 671B that might require two such servers (16 GPUs), you could be looking at ~10 kW continuous draw. Over a day, that’s 240 kWh; over a month, ~7,200 kWh. The energy cost could be a few hundred dollars per month per machine in a best-case region. Efficiency (tokens per joule) tends to improve with newer hardware – the H100 is more energy-efficient than the A100 for the same task, because it finishes the computation faster. Likewise, MI300X with its larger memory might avoid extra memory I/O that would waste energy on an H100. Still, objective data on energy-per-token is sparse in literature. It is generally assumed that **higher throughput = better energy efficiency**, since idle or overhead times waste power. Thus, packing models onto as few servers as possible running near capacity is more efficient than spreading them out. Another aspect is **cooling and form factor** – GPUs like the H100 and MI300X require substantial cooling (often liquid or large fans), which is feasible in data centers but not in edge deployments. That’s a cost/feasibility factor: deploying a 70B+ model in an edge device is currently impractical due to power and cooling needs.

### Cost/Performance Trade-offs

Given the above, practitioners often face trade-offs between hardware cost, throughput, and accuracy. Some key trade-offs highlighted in recent sources:

- **Quantization vs. Hardware:** By using 4-bit or 8-bit quantization, one can drastically cut hardware needs (e.g. running 70B on 2–4 consumer GPUs instead of 8 high-end GPUs)​ [(NODESHIFT.COM)](https://nodeshift.com) [(REDDIT.COM)](https://reddit.com). The trade-off is slight loss in model fidelity and more CPU overhead for quantization. Many find this worthwhile, as the cost savings are immense. Indeed, the **most cost-effective setups** in community forums are often those leveraging *used consumer or datacenter GPUs + aggressive quantization*, reaching acceptable speeds for a fraction of the price of new enterprise gear.

- **Multi-GPU Scaling:** To get higher throughput (say to serve many queries or reach 100 t/s), scaling to multi-GPU is necessary. Here the trade-off is near-linear increase in cost but sub-linear increase in performance (due to overhead and diminishing returns). For example, doubling the GPUs might yield only +70% throughput in some cases​ [(GITHUB.COM)](https://github.com). There’s also a complexity cost: multi-GPU inference requires sharding the model and efficient parallelism (using libraries like DeepSpeed or Megatron-LM inference). The literature suggests using NVLink/NVSwitch interconnected GPUs for best results; if GPUs are only PCIe-connected (no NVSwitch), the limited bandwidth can hurt scaling efficiency for large models.

- **Cloud vs. On-Prem:** From a feasibility standpoint, small organizations often opt for cloud instances despite the high hourly rates, because it avoids the huge upfront investment and maintenance. Others invest in on-prem GPU servers, amortizing the cost over many months of continuous usage. A **hybrid approach** is also noted: keeping part of the model on cheaper CPU servers and only using a GPU when needed. Some AWS cost analyses show that if you can keep an A100 GPU busy close to 100% with batched requests, the cost per inference can beat a CPU-based approach (since you get much faster completion). But if utilization is low, those expensive GPUs “burn money.” Tools that auto-scale GPU instances for LLM workloads (spinning them up only when load is high) are an emerging practice to manage costs.

In terms of **recommended hardware setups**, recent industry benchmarks lean towards configurations like: **4×80GB GPUs for 70B models** as a balance of performance and cost (this can typically handle a few queries in parallel with latency under a second, delivering on the order of 50–100 t/s aggregate). For the largest models (500B+), the *only* viable setups in 2024 were essentially HPC-grade: multi-node clusters or specialized accelerators. The NodeShift guide explicitly recommends an **8–16 GPU cluster** for DeepSeek-671B​ [(NODESHIFT.COM)](https://nodeshift.com). Running a 671B model on anything less is either impossibly slow or requires extremely aggressive distillation. Indeed, one approach to reduce cost is **model distillation** or using smaller “student” models. The DeepSeek authors provided distilled versions down to 14B or 32B that can run on a couple of GPUs​ [(NODESHIFT.COM)](https://nodeshift.com) – these have far lower accuracy but can be useful for certain tasks. This highlights feasibility: today, **671B-scale intelligence comes at a high price**, so often a medium model (like 70B) is chosen in production for cost reasons unless the absolute best quality is needed.

## 5. Gaps and Next Steps

Despite significant progress in 2024, there remain gaps in publicly available data and avenues for future exploration:

- **Limited Benchmarks for 671B (and Beyond):** The 671B parameter model (DeepSeek-R1) is one of the first of its size discussed in public forums, and it uses a sparse MoE design. We lack published benchmarks for any *dense* 500B+ model on GPUs. It’s unclear how a dense 600B model (if one were deployed) would scale across GPUs, or what the latency would be. Future benchmark efforts (e.g., MLPerf Inference) could include larger models to give the community better insight into scaling behavior beyond 70B. This also includes multi-node inference – most current benchmarks are within a single server. As models approach the *trillion*-parameter scale, we need testing of multi-server, distributed inference to identify bottlenecks (network latency, memory coherence issues, etc.).

- **Inference Software Optimization:** Much of the throughput gains in 2024 came from software: optimized runtimes (TensorRT-LLM, FasterTransformer), new algorithms (speculative decoding, 4-bit quantization with minimal accuracy loss), and better cache management. These optimizations need to keep up as model sizes grow. For example, speculative decoding was demonstrated on 70B​ [(DEVELOPER.NVIDIA.COM)](https://developer.nvidia.com) – applying similar techniques to 600B models (perhaps using a 70B draft model for a 600B target model) could be a research direction to speed up huge models. Additionally, techniques like **MoE routing optimization** could be explored so that 671B MoE models utilize GPUs efficiently (ensuring even load across expert shards). The community would benefit from more open-source implementations of these high-end inference tricks, as currently many are in proprietary frameworks.

- **Memory Innovations:** Hardware and system research is needed to handle the memory demands. One gap is the lack of memory-sharing standards across GPUs from different vendors – currently, NVIDIA’s NVLink/NVSwitch is a proprietary solution for memory coherence across GPUs. Efforts like **UCIe (Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express)** and **CXL (Compute Express Link)** might in the future allow building “memory pools” that GPUs can draw from. A forward-looking idea is to have *disaggregated memory* for AI models – for instance, a server with an HBM-based memory pool accessible by multiple GPU or accelerator chips. This could alleviate the need to have all weights duplicated on each device or sharded with complex management. In the near term, we might see GPUs with even larger onboard memory (e.g., OAM modules with HBM3E in Blackwell B100 at 144–180GB). But if models outpace memory, research into **hierarchical offloading** (HBM ⇄ DDR5 ⇄ SSD) will be crucial. The current gap is that tools for seamless CPU offload (like PyTorch’s accelerate or DeepSpeed Zero-Inference) exist, but they often result in significant slowdowns. More work is needed to make offloading strategies smarter – for example, prefetching layers into GPU memory just in time, compression of weights in transit, etc., to better utilize bandwidth.

- **Cost Transparency and Optimization:** Not many papers report *cost per inference* or energy usage explicitly. It would be beneficial for future studies to include these metrics. For instance, a paper might state “Serving Model X at 50 t/s on Y hardware costs $Z per 1000 tokens in power and hardware depreciation.” Such data would help others make informed decisions. There is a gap here in literature, often because companies treat cost structure as sensitive information. Community-led benchmarks (like on HackerNews or Reddit) help fill this gap​ [(REDDIT.COM)](https://reddit.com), but more rigorous analysis would be valuable. A research direction could be exploring **fine-grained power management** for GPU inference – e.g., underclocking memory to save energy when full bandwidth isn’t needed, or batching requests in a way that the GPU can occasionally enter low-power states. These kinds of optimizations are not well-documented yet.

- **Emerging Hardware and Collaboration:** The field should keep an eye on non-GPU solutions as well, because they may alter the landscape of feasibility. TPUs, IPUs, and ASICs like **Cerebras WSE** have shown they can outperform GPUs for large models in some cases​ [(CEREBRAS.AI)](https://cerebras.ai). If those become available (perhaps through cloud APIs), they could be integrated into inference deployments. A gap is that most comparisons today are *vendor-driven* (e.g., Cerebras comparing against Nvidia, or AMD vs Nvidia in MLPerf). Independent evaluations of different hardware on identical workloads would be helpful. As an example, how does a **GPU+CPU hybrid** inference compare with a pure **TPU pod** for a 100B model in terms of cost and latency? Answers to such questions would guide next steps in architecture.

- **Model Design for Efficiency:** On the algorithmic side, one promising direction to ease hardware requirements is to design models that are *parameter-efficient*. Techniques like **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** and sparsity can reduce the effective compute needed at inference. The 671B MoE model is one approach: it achieves very high quality by using many parameters, but only a fraction are used per token. More research could explore other sparse architectures or modular networks where parts of the model activate as needed. If successful, we could get the quality benefits of >500B models with the inference cost closer to a 50B model. This is somewhat outside the pure hardware scope, but it’s a critical co-evolution: hardware advances and model efficiency improvements must go hand-in-hand. Currently, the literature has only a few examples (DeepSeek, GPT-4 is rumored to use sparse experts, etc.), so there’s a gap in understanding the *best practices for deploying MoE models on GPUs*. Community efforts like vLLM and FasterTransformer have begun adding support for MoE, but more empirical data is needed.

**Roadmap and Conclusion:**

To summarize, the past year’s data shows that 70B models are at the edge of what a single GPU can handle, and 600B+ models push into multi-node territory. The **next steps** likely involve: (1) Wider benchmarking of these scales (to gather data on throughput/latency/cost in various settings), (2) Advances in GPU technology – particularly memory capacity and interconnect – which are already coming with products like H200 and Blackwell, and (3) Innovative software to optimize every aspect of inference, from caching to precision to parallelism. As we move into 2025, the community is still learning the “dos and don’ts” of deploying gigantic models. It will be crucial to document and publish results of large-scale inference experiments (including negative results) so that we build a collective understanding. Given the rapid progress, one can be optimistic: what was barely achievable on GPUs a year ago (running a multi-hundred-billion model at all) is now becoming more routine, and hitting target speeds like 100 tokens/s will eventually be feasible with a combination of next-gen GPUs and clever engineering. Until then, careful consideration of hardware requirements – VRAM, throughput, and cost trade-offs – is essential when deciding between a 70B model and a 671B model for any real-world application.
